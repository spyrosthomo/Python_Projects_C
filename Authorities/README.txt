"https://www.diavgeia.gov.gr/" is the website where all the economic movements of greek state authorities are uploaded.

Diaugia or "Διαύγεια", in greek means clarity...

This project is about finding the last movements of each state authority. 

The user enters the authority (university/municipality/ministry..) that he/she wants to search and the program returns the last 10 movements.

------------------ AN EXAMPLE ------------------------
*** This works only in Greek *** 

'πανεπιστημιο' is the greek word for university.

So if the user enters at least 3 letters, for example παν, or even the whole word πανεπιστημιο, 
the program returns a list of all the greek universities. 

Then, the user can choose a number of the list and the 10 last movements appear. :)
